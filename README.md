**Fast** node library which implements many hashing algorithms and media manipulation bindings into a *friendly API* which **discards the use of ML (Machine Learning)** for image semelliance level classsification trough the use of pure math.

üìí ***[Check our Documentation!](https://spigel.gsant.org/)***

### Give it a try üå∏

```bash
npm i spigel
```

### üñºÔ∏è It's simple as:

```ts
import { compare } from 'spigel';

async function someFunction() {
const result = await compare('./example.png', './example2.png', { humanize: true });
// => { distance: 'different', hash: { hashA: '...', hashB: '...' } }
}
```
