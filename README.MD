**Fast** node library which implements many hashing algorithms and media manipulation bindings into a *friendly API* which **discards the use of AI (Artificial Intelligence)** for image semelliance level classsification trough the use of pure math.

### Give it a try üå∏

```bash
npm i tamayo
```

### üñºÔ∏è It's simple as:

```ts
import { compare } from 'tamayo';

async function someFunction() {
const result = await compare('./example.png', './example.jpg');
// => Outputs the difference between the input, and it's correspondent hashes.
}
```
